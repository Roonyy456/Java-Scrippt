<!-- You received user feedback from a contact form in a JSON format. Your task is to:
Convert the JSON string into a usable format.
Use a named arrow function to check if the feedback contains the word "thank" (in any case like "Thank", "THANK", etc.).
If the word is found, show a message "Positive feedback received".
If the word is not found, show "Feedback noted".
Use try-catch to handle any error if the JSON is invalid. -->
