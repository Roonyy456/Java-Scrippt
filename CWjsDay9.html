 <!-- You are helping with a basic user comment system for a website. Your task is to write JavaScript code that does the following:
Check if a user comment contains any digits (like ages, amounts, or phone numbers).
If digits are found, replace them with the word "NUMBER" (case-insensitive and for all matches).
Return both:
Whether a number was found (true/false)
The updated comment with numbers replaced
Test the code using this comment:
 "My son is 12 years old. Our flat number is 45 and contact is 9876543210." -->
