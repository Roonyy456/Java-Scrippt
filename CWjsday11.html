 <!-- Create a system that stores information about books. Each book has a title, author, and price. Your task is to:
Create a class named Book.
Use a constructor to initialize the book title, author, and price.
Use getter methods to return the book title and author.
Use a setter method to update the book price only if it is a number and greater than 0.
Create one object of the Book class, try updating the price using both valid and invalid values, and print the final book details.
