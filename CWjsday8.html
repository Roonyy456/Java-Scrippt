  <!-- You are making a simple calculator for a grocery store. The cashier enters the product code (1 to 3), and the quantity purchased. Based on the product code:
Code 1 is for "Apple" – ₹30 per item
Code 2 is for "Banana" – ₹10 per item
Code 3 is for "Mango" – ₹50 per item
You need to:
Ask the user to enter a product code and quantity.
Use a loop to keep asking until 5 purchases are made.
Use a switch statement to calculate and display the total price for each item.
Use if...else to display a special message if total bill for the item is more than ₹100: "High purchase"; otherwise: "Normal purchase".
If the user enters an invalid product code, skip that iteration using continue. -->
